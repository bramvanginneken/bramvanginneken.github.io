## What you think of as peer review

When you have finished writing your scientific paper, you send it to some journal or conference, and receive reports full of criticism by a few reviewers thast are usually anonymous. They are supposed to be your _peers_ and hence the name peer review. The practice of asking reviewers for advice on whether or not to publish a paper started in the 17th century, but became only popular after the invention of the photocopier in 1959, and Albert Einstein was one of the many scientist who thought peer review was a bad idea. I got that from this [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hequ.12511) on the peer review crisis.

I'm with Albert on this one. I wrote my first paper thirty years ago, my first review a year later, and have since (co-)authored over a thousand papers that were peer-reviewed, reviewed thousands of papers myself, and read many more reviews as assocciate editor or conference organizer. And I've come to the conclusion that peer review is completely broken. I hope to elaborate on that in some future posts. Here I only want to stress that the traditional peer review is only one of at least five ways in which the value of a paper is judged by other researchers.

## 1. Authorship

This is not typically seen as peer review, but actually your co-authors should read your paper critically and help to revise it. By agreeing to be co-author, they give permission to put their name on it, and thus give it a stamp of approval. I think this is the most important form of peer review. Therefore you should post your paper immediately on a preprint server such are [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Unfortunately, [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) does not yet include all arXiv papers, but they are running a [pilot](https://cshl.libguides.com/myncbi/pubmed) on it. I think publishing just on arXiv is the best way forward, and I think [overlay journals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03383) are the future.

## 2. Peer review

After your co-authors approved the paper, the next step is usually peer review, as explained above. So off you go in a cycle of major and minor revisions. Occasionally you get a good review with advice that acutally makes your paper better, but more often you have to comply with the whims of so called peers who typically rushed out their report without have properly read your work because they had no time to do that. I have come to believe that peer review more often makes papers worse than better. I'm thinking about a way to study that scientifically. Feel free to contact me if you have ideas about that or would like to study this together.

## 3. Acceptance by a journal or a conference

If all goes well your paper ends up in some prestigious conference proceddings or journal. This is also a form of peer review. That publication judged your paper good enough to print it. The impact factor of a journal or conference is a measure of their prestige. Google Scholar uses its own metric to rank publications, the [h5-index](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=metrics_intro). You can note there that deep learning is the most important field of research at the moment. 

## 4. Post-publication peer review

After publication, other researcher can praise your work, or at least dicuss it. In editorials, blog posts, podcasts, social media whatever. Attempts to formalize open post-publication peer review in platforms have not been suvccessful. As long as researcher are too busy to do regular peer review, this is not surprising. I think this form of peer review will become more important in the future.  

## 5. Citations

It may be great if you have managed to get your paper into a high impact journal. But remember that this impact factor is some average of the number of citations of recently published papers in that journal. This does not mean that your paper will get a lot of citations. But if it does, this does indicate other researcher found it worthwhile to cite your work. If I want to find out information about a researcher, for example when I am reviewing a grant they wrote, I always look at their Google Scholar profile, even though some funding agencies now forbid this.
