&lt;p>Studying physics was genuinely interesting, and I enjoyed all the math courses as well. But the endless cycle of exams quickly became tedious. Each course followed the same predictable pattern. You always had to prepare for an exam with problems to solve. It could be an electrical circuit, an electron adrift in a field, particles under pressure, it could even be people switching flashlights on and off in trains hurtling near the speed of light, or simply a matrix whose eigenvalues were unknown or an integral or differential equation. The process was always the same: apply the right formulas, avoid getting bogged down in calculations, and arrive at a neatly computed value. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peer review</title><link>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/peer-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/peer-review/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-you-think-of-as-peer-review">What you think of as peer review&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you have finished writing your scientific paper, you send it to a journal or conference and receive reports full of criticism from a few reviewers who are usually anonymous. They are supposed to be your &lt;em>peers&lt;/em>, hence the name peer review. The practice of asking reviewers for advice on whether or not to publish a paper started in the 17th century but only became popular after the invention of the photocopier in 1959. Albert Einstein was one of the many scientists who thought peer review was a bad idea. I got that from this &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hequ.12511">recent paper&lt;/a> on the peer review crisis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thira Lab</title><link>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/thira-lab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/thira-lab/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="icai">ICAI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.icai.ai/">ICAI&lt;/a> labs are a concept initiated at the University of Amsterdam to encourage more collaborations between Dutch universities and companies and societal organizations in the area of artificial intelligence. It&amp;rsquo;s something I always tried to do in my own research group, because the only way to bring the results of our research to the clinic is by working with companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many attempts by academics to do that themselves, providing their software to doctors, maintaining support for that software, and this tends to fail, unfortunately. Companies have been co-funding my research from the beginning, but the ICAI concept gave me an opportunity to take this to the next level. An ICAI lab has at least 5 PhD students and it&amp;rsquo;s a great vehicle to showcase your collaboration with companies in your field. When I learned about it, I started talking to the ICAI people and we decided to set up the first such lab in Nijmegen: Thira Lab. It was a collaboration between my group, &lt;a href="https://delft.care/">Delft Imaging&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://thirona.eu/">Thirona&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Biography #1</title><link>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/bio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bramvanginneken.org/posts/bio/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="youth">Youth&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up in the south of the Netherlands, in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuenen">Nuenen&lt;/a>, a village best known for the fact that Vincent van Gogh was unhappy there for a few years of his life. The second most famous person from Nuenen, dixit Wikipedia, is a computer scientist! Edsger W. Dijkstra lived a few streets away from where I was born. My niece was his neighbor for a while. The &lt;a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">E. W. Dijkstra Archive&lt;/a> is amazing. It has a lot of handwritten manuscripts, even from after 2000. Because, after all, a real computer scientist only needs a pencil and a piece of paper.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
